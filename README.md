# About the Project

A secure and modular Authorization API built with **.NET 6**, providing authentication and role-based access control with possibility of banning users. Secured endpoints using policy-based and role-based authorization, ensuring granular access control using **JWT** standards. The API is designed to be scalable, testable, and container-ready with **Docker**, featuring automated test execution prior to deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
    
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Running the API with Docker

This project uses Docker to build, test, and run the API. It follows a **test-first approach**:

> üß™ The container will first execute all tests.  
> ‚úÖ If tests pass, the API starts.  
> ‚ùå If tests fail, the container exits.

#### To run:

`docker build --rm --no-cache -t authorization-api .`

`docker run -d -p 44383:80 --name authorization-api-container authorization-api`

Then API container is working in the background. To check if it's working, just open in the browser:

`http://localhost:44383/swagger/index.html` 

To stop the container, use:

`docker stop authorization-api-container`

## API Documentation

After running the app, you can explore the API via **Swagger UI** at:
`https://localhost:44383/swagger/index.html`


## Running Tests Locally

If you would like to run tests outside Docker, use:
`dotnet test`
